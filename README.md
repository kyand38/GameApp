## 3 Game modes

As a user, I want to play a trivia game.

21 questions standard
- When the user is taken to the game page they see a button to gereate their first question.
- After answering a question the score is edited acording to if they got the question right.
- The game ends when 21 questions have been answered.

Streak mode
- The same rules as 21 question except the game ends when the user gets a question wrong.

21 questions by catagory
- the same rules as 21 questions standard but the user must interact with a modal to select a category for their trivia.

## User Authentication and Data Security
As a user, I want my personal information and highscore to be secure, so I can feel confident my data is protected.

JWT Authentication for Access Control
- Users are required to log in to access and modify their aurora log. The app uses JWT to verify authenticated sessions, ensuring only authorized users can access protected data.

Secure Environment Variable Management
- All API keys, JWT secrets, and sensitive information are stored securely in environment variables, keeping the app secure and safeguarding external API keys and user information.

Data Privacy Assurance
- User data is protected per best practices in data security, including the encryption of passwords and restriction of access to personal logs to authenticated sessions only.
